# AIP for NFTPrague2024 sponsorship

> ### **PROPOSAL NAME:**

ApeCoin DAO at NFTPrague as an ETHPrague Side Event

> ### **PROPOSAL CATEGORY:**

Ecosystem Fund Allocation

> ### **TEAM DESCRIPTION:**

I am Alok and I am a mobile+web3 developer. I started my Apecoin builder journey at ETHGlobal hackathons, where I built upon and won multiple Apecoin tracks in [Lisbon](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/otherswipe-for-the-otherside-qmdmm), [New York](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/vouch-messenger-qqvjm) and [ETHOnline](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/perks-gv9d1), as part of [AIP-230](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-230-i-dont-hate-apes-i-just-want-them-to-fund-public-goods/11280). I recently got onboarded as a hackathon partner by @maariab for Apecoin DAO at ETHGlobal, where I was responsible for interaction and support for builders, picking web3 tech and trends for bounty tracks and judging projects at ETHGlobal Istanbul Devconnect Edition and ETHGlobal London. 

TLDR; I've built some stuff myself and seen a lot of great work by others for the Apecoin ecosystem.

This proposal seeks funding for ApeCoinâ€™s Gold sponsorship at NFTPrague on 1st June, during Prague Blockchain Week. The Gold sponsorship will include Apecoin DAO members as speakers, opening and closing remarks, and a dedicated booth where we encourage builders and artists on the merits of launching on the Apechain when it goes live. 

At the booth, we will offer exclusive merch and invite attendees to learn more about the Apecoin DAO and its ecosystem. Beyond that, we encourage attendees to acquire a small amount of APE and join Discourse.

With other members joining the stage, we would also offer insights into the ecosystem including but not limited to NFT collections, IP ownership and commercial rights, Made By Apes, etc. 

Any Apecoin DAO member who would like to highlight their ecosystem project is welcome. I also invite the [Czech and Slovak Apes Community](https://twitter.com/CZSKAYC) to join me.

I seek approval to use the Apecoin logo, Powered by Apecoin and MBA trademarks for all branding opportunities. Merch items include holographic Apecoin stickers, similar to the ones at ETHGlobal events below.

> ### **BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM:**

As a side event to the 3rd edition of [ETHPrague 2024](https://ethprague.com/), participating at NFTPrague offers Apecoin DAO and Apechain the opportunity for brand awareness, media exposure and cement its position as the biggest name in the NFT space.

Prague Blockchain Week brings together cryptonatives from all ecosystems: Bitcoin, Monero, Cosmos, Polkadota, and of course, Ethereum at [ETHPrague](https://ethprague.com/).

Prague is a crypto-friendly and vibrant city with roots going back to the original cypherpunk culture and the home to the [Institute of Cryptoanarchy](https://www.paralelnipolis.cz/en/institut-kryptoanarchie/) which was also the venue for [NFTs in Prague 2023](https://polkadotnft.xyz/recap-2023/), organized by the team behind this year's NFTPrague.

Even though the first ever Bitcoin conference took place in Prague decades ago, it still flies under the radar of the modern crypto community. This presents an opportunity for an incredibly cost-effective sponsorship which provides an excellent value to showcase ourselves to a multitude of attendees from all ecosystems, especially the 1500+ attendees and hackers expected at ETHPrague 2024. The event provides a unique opportunity for networking, knowledge sharing, and collaboration with key players within the Web3 industry, not only limited to builders but also the incredible art community of Central Europe which is well-versed in digital art and is no stranger to interactive art houses like the upcoming [Crypto Portal Art Gallery](https://twitter.com/CryptoPortalArt).
